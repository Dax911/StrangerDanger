It contains the same locations and infrastructure as the human world, but it is much darker, colder and obscured by an omnipresent fog. The Upside Down is devoid of human life, instead being overgrown with ropy, root-like tendrils and biological membranes covering practically every surface. At least one recognizable animal, a humanoid creature, is native to this dimension, while ash-like spores float in the air.
Right now you are in the tunnels under Hawkins you need to get out before you succumb to the toxic atmosphere or get sucked into the Upside Down or get hunted down by one of the many Upside Down creatures or something worse happens.  PS This room will soon be overcome by the darkness as well.
